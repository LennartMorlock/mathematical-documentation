On this page, the most important equations like the objective function and constraints are stated.

Objective function
******************


.. math::

	\pi^{\text{objective}} = C_{\text{real}}(\pi^{inv,capa,g},\pi^{omf,capa,g},\pi^{omv,gen,g})+C_{\text{penalty}}(\varepsilon^{\text{deviation}})


Constraints
